The analysis looked at standardized test results for the city's school district. The data included math and reading scores for every student, as well as information on the schools they attended. The analysis was conducted to identify trends in school performance and provide insights for future budget and priority decisions.

Several key findings emerged from the analysis

There were significant variations in school performance across the district. Some schools consistently outperformed others in both math and reading.

School size appeared to be a factor in performance, with smaller schools generally performing better than larger schools.

School type also appeared to be a factor, with charter schools outperforming district schools in both math and reading.
There was a positive correlation between per-student budget and performance, with schools with higher budgets generally performing better than those with lower budgets.

Students in higher grades generally performed better than those in lower grades, although the differences were relatively small.

Based on these findings, the school board and mayor could make decisions about how to allocate future budgets and prioritize resources to improve school performance across the district.
